C wrapper code for Fortran lbfgs and lbfgsb code, see:
http://www.netlib.org/opt/
http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgs.html

lbfgs.h and lbfgs_wrapper.c are for lbfgs, see example sdrive.c 
lbfgsb.h and lbfgsb_wrapper.c are for lbfgsb, see example drive1.c 

tested on Linux, should work fine elsewhere.

sh build.sh to build the example code (you need both fortran (g77) and c compiler)
