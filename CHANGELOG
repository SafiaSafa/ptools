Add this CHANGELOG

31 March - 3 April 2017
- add function get_group()] to split translations into groups; works with lists, tuples, dict (sorts by keys)
- add options --ngroups and -ngroup to split translations into ngroups and work on the ngroup-th one
- add function run_attract() to encompass loop over translations and rotations.
- Responds to issue 84

13 - 19 April
- test_attract.py: add analytical "toy" minimization tests; data in "data/toyminim"
- attract_cmd.py: remove start1 option: all translations/rotations now indicated by number in corresponding file.
- attract_cmd.py: redefine -s to mean a "starting-config-only" run or a run specifying both transnb and rotnb
- add new module (ptools/docking.py) to hold run_attract(), read_translations(), and other functions that had been defined in attract.py
- docking.py: replace Translation and Rotation classes with functions to read translation.dat and rotation.dat files and return dicts indexed by line numbers (1-based).
- When invoked with -s, attract_cmd.py now creates translation and rotation dictionaries with one entry keyed by 0, to indicate a run starting from the provided ligand position and orientation.
- ptools_cli.py: (Issue 82) Add text to docstring with example for getting help for a command, e.g. "ptools attract --help"
