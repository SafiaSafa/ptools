Tutorial: protein-protein and protein-DNA docking with PTools
*************************************************************


This part shows the PTools docking application called ATTRACT [#Zacharias2005]_.
Its usage and capabilities are illustrated by the docking of a protein--protein 
complex (1CGI) and a protein--DNA complex [#Poulain2008]_ (1K79).
The first example (1CGI) is explained step by step and scripts usages are
exhaustively detailled. The second example (1K79) is much more straightforward.
