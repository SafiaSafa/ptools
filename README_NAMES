Making more canonical identifiers in ptools (aprÃ¨s discussion avec Chantal et Benoist)

A. Goals

1. Method and function names should start with a small letter
2. Underscores between words lowercase) should be preferred to camelCase


B. "Domains"

1. Python modules and scripts
2. Cython bindings
3. C/C++ code
4. Fortran code


C. Guiding principles

1. All work should be done in a branch ("renames")
2. To eliminate a manual step for distinguishing C++ and python calls, both C++ and python names will be changed
3. Python scripts alone will be searched in identify names to be changed. This means it is possible that some naming inconsistencies may result on the C++ side. This won't matter in a python-only future.
4. No fortran names will be changed; no fortran subroutines/functions are called directly by python anyway.
5. Automated tools will be used as much as possible to find candidates for renaming and to do the renaming (see "names.py")
6. Attention to the order of the substitutions -- any shorter word should be translated AFTER longer words containing it.


D. Detailed protocol:

1. Find names using regular expressions: any name with letters and numbers and _, preceded by '.' and followed by '('

	$ sed --in-place 's/CONTEXT = True/CONTEXT = False/' names.py
	$ python names.py find ../ptools ../ptools-vrac > NAMES

	$ sed --in-place 's/CONTEXT = False/CONTEXT = True/' names.py
	$ python names.py find ../ptools ../ptools-vrac > NAMES_WITH_CONTEXT

2. Eliminate as many known PTools class names as possible

	$ grep -vf CLASS_NAMES_PYTHON NAMES > METHOD_NAMES

3. Manually eliminate any names referring to external modules, classes, or names that are already OK. It helps to look in NAMES_WITH_CONTEXT, or grep other context examples if in doubt.

	$ vi METHOD_NAMES

4. Add 2nd column with new method names (translations)

	$ cp METHOD_NAMES METHOD_NAMES_TXN
	$ vi !$

5. Verify that no old names are present in multiple locations in the names list

	$ grep -f METHOD_NAMES METHOD_NAMES_TXN
	$ grep -cf METHOD_NAMES METHOD_NAMES_TXN (compare count to wc METHOD_NAMES)

6. Verify the order of the substitutions list! Any shorter word should be translated AFTER longer words containing it. Note that the translations are thus processed as a list, not a dictionary.

7. To overwrite just the source file changes with the committed version

	- all changes:		git checkout -- .

	- specific filetypes: git checkout -- "*.py" "*.pyx" "*.cpp" "*.h"

8. I added new Makefile targets "undo" and "rename" for the commands often used in this branch
