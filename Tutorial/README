How to use the library
=======================

I) compiling:
You need some packages in order to generate the library from the source code:
   - a C++ compiler (of course).
     g++ was used to develop the library. Others compilers should also work
     (if it doesn't work, please send me an e-mail adrien.saladin@gmail.com)

   - a fortran 77 compiler
     in order to compile third-party files like the L-BFGS quasi-newton minimizer

   - python and python development files
     (debian packages 'python' and 'python-dev')
     (by python I mean the CPython implementation of python. www.python.org)

   - the boost::python library
     (dynamic library + development files)
     this is a fantastic library which wrap the python C API for c++ programs

   - gccxml, pygccxml, pyplusplus:
     if you want to modify the C++ library, you will need to re-generate the python
     interface (running 'python interface.py'). You need these packages in order to do it.
     (you can download them at http://www.language-binding.net/index.html)

   - the 'scons' utility
     this is the 'make' system for this library. Regular makefiles may be provided
     at some time.

simply type:
a)  'scons cpp'  to generate the c++ library only
b)  ' python interface.py && scons python' to generate the python-importable library
c)  'scons' to generate both libraries.




II) Testing:
Some unit test are provided in order to check if the library behaves correctly on your system.
You need to compile the python library in order to use these unit tests (see above).
to run them, type 'python unittest1.py' in the Test/ directory.
If everything goes fine you should get something like:
"""
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.000s

OK
"""

if not, then contact me ;-)  (adrien.saladin@gmail.com)


III) Documentation:
Source code may be parsed by an automatic documentation generator called 'Doxygen'.
This documentation may only help for the C++ part of the library.
after installing Doxygen, simply type 'doxygen' in the directory which contains the 'Doxyfile'.
Then look into the html/ directory and find the index.html file generated...
