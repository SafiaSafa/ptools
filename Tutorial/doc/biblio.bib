  abstract = {A reduced protein model combined with a systematic docking approach
	has been employed to predict protein-protein complex structures in
	CAPRI rounds 6-11. The docking approach termed ATTRACT is based on
	energy minimization in translational and rotational degrees of freedom
	of one protein with respect to the second protein starting from many
	thousand initial protein partner placements. It also allows for approximate
	inclusion of global flexibility of protein partners during systematic
	docking by conformational relaxation of the partner proteins in precalculated
	soft collective backbone degrees of freedom. We have submitted models
	for six targets, achieved acceptable docking solutions for two targets,
	and predicted >20\% correct contacts for five targets. Possible improvements
	of the docking approach in particular at the scoring and refinement
	steps are discussed.},

  abstract = {Coarse grain modelling of macromolecules is a new approach, potentially
	well adapted to answer numerous issues, ranging from physics to biology.
	We propose here an original DNA coarse grain model specifically dedicated
	to protein-DNA docking, a crucial, but still largely unresolved,
	question in molecular biology. Using a representative set of protein-DNA
	complexes, we first show that our model is able to predict the interaction
	surface between the macromolecular partners taken in their bound
	form. In a second part, the impact of the DNA sequence and electrostatics,
	together with the DNA and protein conformations on docking is investigated.
	Our results strongly suggest that the overall DNA structure mainly
	contributes in discriminating the interaction site on cognate proteins.
	Direct electrostatic interactions between phosphate groups and amino
	acid side chains strengthen the binding. Overall, this work demonstrates
	that coarse grain modeling can reveal itself a precious auxiliary
	for a general and complete description and understanding of protein-DNA
	association mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Protein-protein complex structures have been predicted for CAPRI Rounds
	3 and 5 using a reduced protein model. Proteins are represented by
	up to 3 pseudoatoms per amino acid. The docking approach termed ATTRACT
	is based on energy minimization in translational and rotational degrees
	of freedom of one protein with respect to another protein. The reduced
	protein model allows one to perform systematic docking minimization
	of many thousand start structures in reasonable computer time. Flexibility
	of critical surface side-chains can be accounted for by a multiple
	conformational copy approach. The multicopy approach allows simultaneous
	adjustment of side-chain conformations and optimization of translational
	and rotational degrees of freedom of one protein with respect to
	the partner during docking. For 3 (Targets 8, 14, and 19) out of
	5 CAPRI targets, the approach resulted in predictions in close agreement
	with experiment [root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of backbone atoms
	within 10 A of the protein-protein interface < 1.8 A]. The comparison
	of predicted and experimental structures of the CAPRI targets indicates
	that besides local conformational changes (e.g., changes in side-chain
	conformations), global conformational changes of the protein backbone
	can be critical for complex formation. These conformational changes
	not accounted for during docking are a likely reason for the unrealistic
	predictions in 2 cases (Targets 9 and 18).},
