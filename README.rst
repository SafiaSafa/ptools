About
-----
**PTools** is an opensource molecular docking library implemented in Python/C++. The PTools library has been designed in order to perform molecular and macromolecular assembly tasks efficiently and to facilitate further development. PTools includes an implementation of the ATTRACT docking program (Zacharias M. (2003) Protein Science 12:1271).

PTools was started by Adrien Saladin and Chantal Prévost, in collaboration with Pierre Poulain, Sébastien Fiorrucci and Martin Zacharias, with further development in collaboration with Benoist Laurent, Tap Ha-Duong and Charles Robert.
