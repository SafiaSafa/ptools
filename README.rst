About
-----
**PTools** is an opensource molecular docking library implemented in Python/C++. PTools is designed to perform molecular and macromolecular assembly tasks efficiently, while facilitating development of new analyses in structural biology. PTools includes an implementation of the ATTRACT docking program (Zacharias M. (2003) Protein Science 12:1271).

PTools was begun by Adrien Saladin and Chantal Prévost, in collaboration with Pierre Poulain, Sébastien Fiorrucci and Martin Zacharias. Further development has benefited from collaboration with Benoist Laurent, Tap Ha-Duong and Charles Robert.
