The PTools library
=======================


Documentation:
--------------

The documentation is provided in the 'Tutorial/doc' directory. Simply run 'make' in this directory 
to get a pdf documentation.

Source code may be parsed by an automatic documentation generator called 'Doxygen'.
This documentation may only help for the C++ part of the library.
after installing Doxygen, simply type 'doxygen' in the directory which contains the 'Doxyfile'.
Then look into the html/ directory and find the index.html file generated...
